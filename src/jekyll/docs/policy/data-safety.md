## Google Data Safety

According to [Google’s data safety](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/10787469?hl=en#zippy=%2Cdata-types%2Cwhat-users-will-see%2Cdata-collection%2Cpurposes%2Coptional-format-for-sdks%2Cdata-sharing%2Cdata-handling%2Cother-app-and-data-disclosures%2Ccommitted-to-follow-the-families-policy-available-soon-to-applicable-apps%2Cam-i-required-to-provide-a-deletion-mechanism-must-it-be-for-any-and-all-user-data%2Chow-should-i-treat-the-collection-and-use-of-ip-addresses) policy, all developers must declare how they collect and handle user data for the apps they publish on
Google Play, and provide details about how they protect this data through security practices like encryption. This
includes data collected and handled through any third party libraries or SDKs used in their apps, such as Tapsell. In
order to facilitate this process, we’ve disclosed the Tapsell data collection below.

> The following disclosures include the data collected by Tapsell SDK only.
