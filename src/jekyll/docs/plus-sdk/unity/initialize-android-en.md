## Adding Yelloadwise Unity package
There are two ways to add the required libraries, use method 2 (Resolver) for Yelloadwise v2.1.8 or above.

### 1. Using Gradle
1. First, download Tepsell Plus `unitypackage` from [this link](https://github.com/irancell/YelloadwiseSDK-UnitySample2019/releases/download/V2.1.7/YelloadwiseUnity-Gradle-v2.1.7.unitypackage).
2. Add the downloaded `unitypackage` to your project as follows: (If the Yelloadwise folder already exists in your project, please remove it).

    ```
    Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...
    ```

3. Add your own custom Gradle build file by enabling related checkboxes as follows:

    ```console
    Edit > Project Setting... > Player > Publishing Settings > Custom Launcher Gradle Template
    Edit > Project Setting... > Player > Publishing Settings > Custom Main Gradle Template
    Edit > Project Setting... > Player > Publishing Settings > Custom Base Gradle Template
    Edit > Project Setting... > Player > Publishing Settings > Custom Gradle Properties Template
    ```

4. To enable AndroidX, go to `Assets\Plugins\Android\gradle.properties` and add the following code snippet to it:
    ```gradle
    android.useAndroidX=true
    android.enableJetifier=true
    ```

5. Go to `Assets\Plugins\Android\mainTemplate.gradle` and delete the comment line above the file.
    ```gradle
    // GENERATED BY UNITY. REMOVE THIS COMMENT TO PREVENT OVERWRITING WHEN EXPORTING AGAIN
    ```
    Then add the following line in the `dependencies` section:
    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        ...
        implementation 'ir.yelloadwise:yelloadwise-sdk-unity:2.1.7'
        ...
    **DEPS**}
    ```

    Add the following code snippet if not already added:

    ```gradle
    android {
      compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
      }
    }
    ```

6. If you are using Unity version 2019 and below, please refer to `Assets\Plugins\Android\baseProjectTemplate.gradle` and add `mavenCentral()` to both `repositories`. Then change the version of `com.android.tools.build:gradle` to 3.6.0.


    > Note that using version 3.6.0 is required for the Android Gradle Plugin to support Android 11 in the project only when you are using Unity version 2019 and below. You can get help from [this link](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/android-11-build) to add a version of Gradle that supports Android 11.

7. After adding Yelloadwise and other Ad Networks, you will probably need to enable MultiDex due to the increase in code size and method counts to prevent the following error. If you are using the Android `minSDKVersion` API 21 or above, `MultiDex` is activated by default. otherwise you need to enable it manually.
    
    ```console
    D8: Cannot fit requested classes in a single dex file (# methods: 68109 > 65536)
    ```
   
    To enable MultiDex, go to `Assets\Plugins\Android\launcherTemplate.gradle` and add the following code snippet to it:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
      def multidex_version = "2.0.1"
      implementation "androidx.multidex:multidex:$multidex_version" // 2.0.1
    }
   
    android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
        ...
        multiDexEnabled true
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
   Then Go to `Assets\Plugins\Android\AndroidManifest.xml` and apply one of the `a.`,` b.`, or `c.` Depending on your project's implementation:
   
   a. If you haven't already added the `Application` class to your project, add the following code snippet to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
    ```xml
    <application
      android:name="androidx.multidex.MultiDexApplication" >
    <!--  ...-->
    </application>
    ```
   b. Otherwise, If you have already added the `Application` class to your project, and you have configured it in your `AndroidManifest.xml` , Go to your `Application` class and extend it from `MultiDexApplication` as follows:
    ```java
     public class MainApplication extends MultiDexApplication {
      // your code
     }
    ```
   c. But, If you extend the `Application` class from another class, and you can't extend it from `MultiDexApplication`, you can `override` the `attachBaseContext` method as follows:
    ```java
     public class MainApplication extends SomeOtherApplication {
      // your code

        @Override
        protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
            super.attachBaseContext(base);
            MultiDex.install(this);
        }
    }
   ```
   You can also refer to [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex) for more information. 
   

### 2. Using Resolver

1. First, download the [unitypackage resolver](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver/tags) file. Then add it to your project according to the description of the following link:

    [Google Documentation](https://github.com/googlesamples/unity-jar-resolver#android-resolver-usage)

2. check `Jetifier` and` Auto Resolution` from the following menus: (Auto Resolution check is optional, but it's better to enable it so that you do not have to resolve libraries manually each time)

    ```console
    Assets > External Dependency Manager > Android Resolver > Settings > Use Jetifier
    Assets > External Dependency Manager > Android Resolver > Settings > Enable Auto-Resolution
    ```

3. First, download Tepsell Plus `unitypackage` from [this link](https://github.com/irancell/YelloadwiseSDK-UnityPlugin/releases/download/v2.2.0/irancell.ir-plus-unity-2.2.0.unitypackage).
4. Add the downloaded `unitypackage` to your project as follows: (If the `YelloadwiseSDK` folder already exists in your project, please remove it).

    ```console
    Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...
    ```

5. Resolve libraries through the following menu to ensure that the Yelloadwise plugin is added:

    ```console
    Assets > External Dependency Manager > Android Resolver > Force Resolve
    ```

6. Add your own custom Gradle build file by enabling related checkboxes as follows:

    ```console
    Edit > Project Setting... > Player > Publishing Settings > Custom Launcher Gradle Template
    Edit > Project Setting... > Player > Publishing Settings > Custom Base Gradle Template
    Edit > Project Setting... > Player > Publishing Settings > Custom Gradle Properties Template
    ```

7. To enable AndroidX, go to `Assets\Plugins\Android\gradle.properties` and add the following code snippet to it:
    ```gradle
    android.useAndroidX=true
    android.enableJetifier=true
    ```
   
8. Go to `Assets\Plugins\Android\launcherTemplate.gradle`, and add the following code snippet to it if not already added:

    ```gradle
    android {
      compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
      }
    }
    ```

9. Go to `Assets\Plugins\Android\baseProjectTemplate.gradle` and add `mavenCentral()` to both `repositories`. Then change the version of `com.android.tools.build:gradle` to 4.2.2.


    > Note that at least version 3.6.0 is required for the Android Gradle Plugin to support Android 11 in the project. You can get help from [this link](https://developers.google.com/ar/develop/unity/android-11-build) to add a version of Gradle that supports Android 11.

10. After adding Yelloadwise and other Ad Networks, you will probably need to enable MultiDex due to the increase in code size and method counts to prevent the following error. If you are using the Android `minSDKVersion` API 21 or above, `MultiDex` is activated by default. otherwise you need to enable it manually.

    D8: Cannot fit requested classes in a single dex file (# methods: 68109 > 65536)
    ```

    To enable MultiDex, go to `Assets\Plugins\Android\launcherTemplate.gradle` and add the following code snippet to it:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
      def multidex_version = "2.0.1"
      implementation "androidx.multidex:multidex:$multidex_version" // 2.0.1
    }
   
    android {
      ...
      defaultConfig {
        ...
        multiDexEnabled true
      }
      ...
    }
    ```
    Then Go to `Assets\Plugins\Android\AndroidManifest.xml` and apply one of the `a.`,` b.`, or `c.` Depending on your project's implementation:

    a. If you haven't already added the `Application` class to your project, add the following code snippet to your `AndroidManifest.xml`:
    ```xml
    <application
     android:name="androidx.multidex.MultiDexApplication" >
    <!--  ...-->
    </application>
    ```
    b. Otherwise, If you have already added the `Application` class to your project, and you have configured it in your `AndroidManifest.xml` , Go to your `Application` class and extend it from `MultiDexApplication` as follows:
    ```java
    public class MainApplication extends MultiDexApplication {
    // your code
    }
    ```
    c. But, If you extend the `Application` class from another class, and you can't extend it from `MultiDexApplication`, you can `override` the `attachBaseContext` method as follows:
    ```java
    public class MainApplication extends SomeOtherApplication {
    // your code
    
            @Override
            protected void attachBaseContext(Context base) {
                super.attachBaseContext(base);
                MultiDex.install(this);
            }
        }
    ``` 
   You can also refer to [official documentation](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/multidex) for more information. 
   

## Initialization
First, use the following code snippet to access Tepsell dependency codes.

    ```c#
    using YelloadwiseSDK;
    ```

Then call the following function in one of your application scripts that runs at the beginning of the program.

    ```c#
    Yelloadwise.Initialize(Yelloadwise_KEY,
                adNetworkName => Debug.Log(adNetworkName + " Initialized Successfully."),
                error => Debug.Log(error.ToString()));
    ```

`Yelloadwise_KEY` is the key of TepsellPlus and it is created in [Tepsell panel](https://dashboard.irancell.ir/) for every application you create and you can copy it from the panel.

You can now display the desired ad according to your needs and the description of each type of ad.

## GDPR Configuration
Given that The Tepsel Plus library complies with the GDPR rules for displaying personalized ads, by default if the user uses your application with the IP of one of the countries covered by this law, it will display a dialog to user. If you want to determine the necessary access by yourself, instead of the user's decision, you can use the following code snippet, you can use the following code snippet. Note that this code snippet must be called after Tepsel Plus is initialized and before the ad request is applied to the result of your request. A value of true‌ means that you give ad networks the right to use the information to display personalized advertising.
    ```c#
    Yelloadwise.SetGdprConsent(true);
    ```
